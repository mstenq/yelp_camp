### Mongo Model and Schema Sample
Models go in the `/models` directory and should always be named **singularly**. 

**FILE NAMING CONVENTION**
- Separate words with hyphens (i.e. `-`)
- Should be named singularly (e.g. `comment.js` not `comments.js`) Note that when they are saved to Mongo, they will automatically be pluralized.
- File names should have a terse one or two word name that describes the material covered in the document.

**FIELD NAMES**
- Use camelCase.
- Donâ€™t use _ underscore as the starting character of the field name. The only field with _ undescore should be _id.
- Field names cannot contain . dots or null characters and must not start with a $ dollar sign.


Below is an example of `/models/comment.js`.
```javascript
//REQUIRE MONGOOSE
var mongoose = require("mongoose");

//SETUP SCHEMA
var commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    author: String,
    text: String
});

//CREATE NEW MODEL
var Comment = mongoose.model("Comment", commentSchema);

//EXPORT MODEL FOR USE IN OTHER FILES
module.exports = Comment;
```
